HUMANS CAN PERCEIVE over 2.8 million different hues, the number of possible combinations is virtually infinite; to assemble a color theme for code editors is tedious. The combination has to be practical, beautiful and easy on the eyes.

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and GUI applications. [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/) designed this colorscheme with both precise [CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships:

> On a sunny summer day I love to read a book outside. Not right in the sun; that’s too bright. I’ll hunt for a shady spot under a tree. The shaded paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely. If you were to actually measure the contrast between the two, you’d find it is much lower than black text on a white background (or white on black) on your display device of choice. Black text on white from a computer display is akin to reading a book in direct sunlight and tires the eye.

Solarized is a low contrast colorscheme that retains contrasting hues for syntax highlighting readability. Its light and dark background modes retain the same selective contrast relationship and overall feel. I use the light mode during daylight and the dark mode at night.

I use Solarized in [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/); further application specific color themes are available for most common editors and IDEs.

In [Changelog Episode 0.7.7](http://thechangelog.com/post/20168759748/episode-0-7-7-solarized-and-linux-on-the-desktop-with-et): [Wynn Netherland](http://wynnnetherland.com/) sat down with Ethan Schoonover to talk about the science and design behind the wildly popular color scheme as well as his love for [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/).

I delight in my editor because it allows me to be a programmer. Solarized is the color scheme I was looking for. Come join us in the shade.
